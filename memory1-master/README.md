### Description:

Memoryone.xyz is a website that allows a user to train and test their memorization of a map from 26 characters each to one of ten digits. The website is designed for anyone wanting to test their memorization capabilities. Beyond entertainment, map based memorization has potential applications to online authentication.

### How it works:

First, the user navigates to our website and logins in with their Google account.  A first time user is assigned a randomly generate map from letters to digits that will stick with the user.  Next, the user goes to training tasks 1, 2, and 3 to learn their map.  Once the map is memorized, the user can take the test and compete for a position on the leaderboard.


### Development:

* Client-side code utilizes: HTML, JavaScript, CSS/Bootstrap

* Server-side code utilizes: PHP, MySQL

### Future work:

* More training methods
* More testing methods with scoring system
* Variable difficulty maps (changing map size, key space, value space)
