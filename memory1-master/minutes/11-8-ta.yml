  {ubit: alee22, progress: Designed the badges and badge requirements for the badge system.},
  {ubit: jacondel, progress: Account page now allows you to enter a username, so e-mail isn't always displayed on scoreboard. Other technical fixes.},
  {ubit: yonghyun, progress: Added progress bar to train1.html (an old version by mistake), and improved the user feedback on train1.},

issues: [
  {ubit: everyone, issue: What if someone hits the back button on their browser durng the test?}
  {ubit: everyone, issue: Besides implementing a timer, how do we stop people from cheating during the test (writing down their map on paper)?}
  {ubit: anyone, issue: A user-agreement document may need to be written because our purpose is research.
  {ubit: everyone, issue: We still don't have much in the way of incentive for users. Would any of us want to participate in our research?}

Notes:  | 
We are going to do beta testing on 11/16 at 2pm. We will need a debug/suggestion form for users to fill out, and whatever else.

We need the test page to return more information to the DB. At a minimum, time remaining. At best, which Q's were answered right+wrong.
Test page and Train2 page need CSS.
Train2 needs more feedback for wrong answers, or else it gets boring.
Train2 needs its table displayng properly.
The technical issues above.
Train1 could get some CSS that adjusts font colors as stuff is typed, and text box should always be "on focus" (don't have to keep clicking it).
Scoreboard should not display e-mails, it should display a name instead.
Security Problems include logout verification, cookie redirecting (login verification), and converting scoreboard to .html instead of .php.
Instructions could be added to each page.
The badge graphics must be credited as being from... wherever they came from.

NOTE FOR GRADING, I (rktaylor) tend to understate everyone else's tasks, because there's too much going on at once during our meetings.
