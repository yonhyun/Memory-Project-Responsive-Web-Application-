Notes:  | 
Aside from asking Jake about his php/js files for DB access, our tasks were mostly independent from one another's.
We therefore did not meet each other often outside of TA meetings, where Mike checked up on our progress.

There were very likely several small meetings between two or three of us which I am forgetting. For instance, Ben and Jacob
  definitely spent time outside of TA meetings tweaking php files related to the server and DB, and also considering
  technical issues, such as how to maintain user data after their cookies expire.
  
There were also some extra talks with Mike before and after meetings, involving a variety of topics, such as the legality
  of collecting research data with open-source code, dealing with GitHub's weirdness, and how to have everyone set up
  their own directory within the server (also covered in a TA meeting).

10/28 UPDATE: A real meeting took place on 10/28, where many bugs were fixed and last-minute tasks were assigned. Check out that file.
We did have a lot of last-second problems, like Kang breaking Jacob's dbAccess.php file, and also we assigned Julius the task of
  linking our files on the main website, but we also banned everyone from tinkering with the main website until the end of the
  sprint, so while Julius did accomplish his task on his directory of the server, we otherwise made it impossible for him. Finally,
  Andrew was having trouble getting his DB Accesses to work for his Training page. All of these problems are now resolved, fortunately.
  
Jacob ultimately had to do a little bit of everyone's job in order to keep things together for this sprint, in addition to his own
  tasks. He deserves a freaking medal or something.
