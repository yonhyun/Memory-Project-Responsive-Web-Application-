Andrew keeps providing food for us.

Sprint 2 Req's:
-Make sure to keep submitting these minutes to the DEVELOP branch.
 +You must have 3 TA meetings, 3 Student meetings, and 1 instructor meeting.
-You get points for showing up to the meetings, and communicating in general.
-Push your code to the FEATURE branch first.
-Make sure every week you have a commit submitted.

We now have the "Issues" tab in GitHub, each major task has one, with two people per task.
If we use a password system, we need to make the server more secure (people have to learn hashing)
Ben propsed us using Google API and people's google accounts. Login with email.

TASKS
Someone work on the "Start Page"; how we'll store the data and the actual design of the page.
Someone make the test. It should be a sequence of challenges. One person designs the skeleton of the page (me!), the other designs the challenge itself.
Someone has to handle the data created by users' results.
