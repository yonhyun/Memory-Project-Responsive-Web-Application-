Notes:  | 
If the users input anything in a text box, it must be encrypted and checked before reaching the server, to prevent SQL hacks.
Mike put a branch on GitHub called "Mike's Resources", for now he has a file that can deal with SQL injections.
Mike will purchase the domain name memoryone.xyz
We're gonna meet in groups of two for our student meetings.
