Notes:  | 
Ryan had to do Andrew's job. Andrew is now bugfixing what Ryan did.
Julius broke some of Ben's functionality at one point. Ben had to do a little extra work because of that.

We will send AJAX requests to the php files with javascript to access the database. Jacob has already written that javascript for us.
Our video submission for Sprint2 can be just a compilation of what each subgroup has accomplished;
We do not need to strain ourselves to get everything working together perfectly yet. That'll probably be Sprint 3 or 4.
HOWEVER, we do all need to have files in the Master branch by the end of Sprint 2.

New Tasks--
We have five pages that we need to link together properly, both for moving foward and backward.
The test page has plenty of bugs.
Login has to be integrated with DB, and login credentials maintained as the user progresses.
The test page will have to implement the DB usage to get the map that was generated.
The Training Page is still completely undesigned.

Specific tasks for Andrew and Ryan:
Andrew's gonna create our Youtube video, and also fix the bugs related to the generation of numbers on the test page.
Ryan's gonna change the test page to include a little more CSS, and also fix the bugs related to determining correct answers and randomizing the correctness of the answer choices.

Everyone else is just gonna keep doing what they were doing; they were doing a good job.
