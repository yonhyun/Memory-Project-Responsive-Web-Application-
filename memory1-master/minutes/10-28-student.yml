  {ubit: everyone, issue: Besides implementing a timer, how do we stop people from cheating during the test (writing down their map on paper)?}

Notes:  | 
If it's not broken, don't try to fix it!
If we're near the end of a sprint, don't touch sensitive files (unless they're broken).
Don't delete any branches on GitHub! At least, not until we all have a final grade in this course.
Who's gonna shoot the video this time?

At our next TA meeting, I'd like for us to make an outline of just what all the DB's are holding, 
  to avoid confusion down the road when more than one of us designs a training page.
  
We should be careful with that Nav bar at the top of the site, 'cuz we don't want people going back once they start a test.

Previous minutes files have left people with blank task completion, but everyone has indeed been working on something over time.

Ryan: Get rid of the Begin Test button. Move those function calls inside the callback!
