Notes:  | 
We need the whole train3 page. It should include audio/visual/movement.
We need the test page to return more information to the DB. At a minimum, time remaining. At best, which Q's were answered right+wrong.
Test page should not have radio buttons anymore; it should have all 10 buttons appear so guessing is much more difficult OR...
Test page should take away points for a wrong answer, and have an option to pass a question.
Test page and Train2 page need CSS.
Test page should have that Begin Test button removed (quick and easy).
Train2 needs more feedback for wrong answers, or else it gets boring.
Train2 needs its table displayng properly.
The technical issues above.
Train1 could get some CSS that adjusts font colors as stuff is typed, and text box should always be "on focus" (don't have to keep clicking it).
Scoreboard should not display e-mails, it should display a name instead.
Security Problems include logout verification, cookie redirecting (login verification), and converting scoreboard to .html instead of .php.
Instructions could be added to each page.
Realistic task could be posting scores to facebook.
Could give people badges for various accomplishments?

Are we gonna keep this thing open-source? Sounds like nobody objects to that. (That requires a licence, otherwise we just have default copyright.)

NOTE FOR GRADING, I (rktaylor) tend to understate everyone else's tasks, because there's too much going on at once during our meetings.
