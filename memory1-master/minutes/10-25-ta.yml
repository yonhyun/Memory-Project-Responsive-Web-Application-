  {ubit: rktaylor, issue: It seems activity has been low and communication has been poor amongst the group this sprint.}

Notes:  | 
We need to link our pages together so we can make sure stuff works!
Every group's project is on the course website.
We'll make sure everything's working Friday at 3 in another meeting.

We all need a virtual box so we can test our code, or some other means of testing without breaking stuff.
/var/www/html is our directory on our server.

Specific Tasks:
Ryan: (Small note to self: Adapt test page code to generate only false values 0-9.)
Ryan: The time remaining must be sent to Kang's php script for the leaderboards (Write a function similar to addScoreToDBSuccess).
Julius: Add the link to Ryan's test page to the main website.
