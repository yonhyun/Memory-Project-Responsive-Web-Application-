Notes:  | 
We want the map for a user to be saved, and they can generate a new map if they so wish for a new test.
We want their map to be displayed on their login page.

We have five pages that we need to link together properly, both for moving foward and backward.
Login has to be integrated with DB, and login credentials maintained as the user progresses.
The test page will have to implement the DB usage to get the map that was generated. Ajax requests will be involved.
The test page still looks a little... bland.
We could incorporate a survey for which traiing method was most effective.

We may need a very basic Terms & Conditions & Privacy policy.

The training page is completely undesigned. Ideally, it has a bunch of different methods of assisting the user.
Audio, visuals, colors, shapes, accelerometer, etc. Ben also has a matching game idea.
We do not want the task to be too tedious, however, do we?

New Tasks--
Jacob will integrate the home page with his DB, then next week show the client side what he did.
Ryan will handle making the test pull data from the DB, and sending score info to it.
Kang will make an accessor to the scoreboard database, and modify it.
Andrew will work on CSS styling the test page.
Ben is currently assigned designing the first training page. But he's rusty with front-end code.
